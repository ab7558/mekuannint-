    <div id="part1"><p>Some of you on social media lamented our choice for grouping England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland together as the United Kingdom together. We chose to do so this time to highlight the diverse beauty that the different corners of this collective nations offer to visitors. Many of you praised the “amazing variety of landscapes in a small area”. Of your favourites, the Lake District in England, Scottish Highlands and Welsh coastline were recurring themes. If you live in the UK and tend to travel abroad for holidays why not plan a staycation and explore some of the beautiful places right on your doorstep.Our favourite activity in the UK: Harry Potter Walking Tour in London

        <div id="h2"><h2>The Most Beautiful Natural Features in the UK</h2></div>
        <div id="part2"><p>The beautiful natural features of the UK may not be the first things that spring to mind when planning a visit to England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Most people planning their first visit think about the country's cities — London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool — its industrial history or its stately homes, castles and cathedrals.

            But the UK is a surprisingly green island with a deeply indented coastline of almost 20,000 miles (including the offshore islands). Within its boundaries, the UK is a sort of world in miniature — with canyons, mountains, river valleys, deep, beautiful lakes and amazing beaches. These are among the best of its natural wonders.In July 2017, England's Lake District became a UNESCO World Heritage site.  The somewhat controversial designation was in recognition of its traditional sheep farming, but that's not why we've chosen it for this list.

            Instead, we're attracted to it's wild, lonely beauty and for the range and variety of its lakes and lakeland fells (a word the Vikings brought to Britain for mountains). From the genteel loveliness of Lake Windermere (the largest natural lake in England and a resort since the railroad arrived in 1847) to the stark drama of Scafell Pike, England's highest peak, and the Screes, seen here from Wastwater. 
            
            Wastwater, at 260 feet deep, is the deepest of the Lake District lakes. The Screes, running along the southeast shore, are made up of millions of broken stones left after the last Ice Age that rise from the bottom of the lake to a height of 2,000 feet.
            
            How to See It
            
            Once voted Britain's favorite view, the lake and Scafell Pike are owned by the National Trust. The Trust operates a campsite between Wastwater and Wasdale Head at one end of the lake, with wild camping, glamping and camping pods as well as facilities for camper vans.There is also limited parking around the lake. The Lake is off the A590 in Cumbria over rural and mountain roads.</p></div>
