    <div id="mainhead"><h1>2) New Zealand</h1>
    <div id="part1"><p>In second place is New Zealand. You chose it for the "endless beautiful landscapes" (like one of the worlds' top volcanoes), and the respect residents show for nature. Here you can taste deliciously crisp white wines in the South Island's Marlborough Region. Or, indulge your inner daredevil with bungee jumping in Queenstown, then tap into chilled out beach-city life in Auckland. From golfing to mountain biking, outdoor adventures come as standard in this famously friendly country. New Zealand is best experienced via a road trip - check here for some inspiration on the best routes.
